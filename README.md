# React Counter User Data App

This repository contains a simple React application that fetches and displays user data from a public API. The app allows users to navigate through different user records using a counter.

- Displays user details including:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Website
- Modular CSS (`styles.module.css`) for organized and reusable styles.
